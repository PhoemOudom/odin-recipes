- **Structure HTML Documents:** You will learn to use HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images to create a well-structured document.
- **Implement Semantic HTML:** Understand and utilize semantic tags to improve accessibility and search engine optimization.
- **Organize Project Files:** Use a logical file structure to keep HTML, CSS, and image files organized.
- **Version Control with Git:** Initialize a Git repository and commit your changes to track the progress of your project.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing the Recipes Project, you will have:

- A fundamental understanding of HTML.
- The ability to create simple, static web pages
- Familiarity with best practices for structuring web content.
